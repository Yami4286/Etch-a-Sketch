# Etch-a-Sketch

Yeah its done just one last project before i am finished with foundations
it took me a month to reach here, if anyone wonder , but i was already famaliar with concepts
as i was a coder before i started this course
Anyway i had no idea what etch-a-sketch meant and i created somewhat similar to a tile generating thing
but i am finished with it now
